Companion repository for the paper "Analyzing BERT Cross-lingual Transfer Capabilities in Continual Sequence Labeling".

This project contains all the scripts and information needed to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper.

## Citation

## Installation

1) Create `conda` environment:

```shell
conda create -n ctcnlu python=3.8
conda activate ctcnlu
```

2) Install PyTorch (>=1.7.1) following the instructions of the [docs](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally)

3) Install dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

### Configuration file

Each experiment needs a YAML configuration file including various paths and hyper-parameters.

`example_config.yml` is an example of a configuration file.

### Dataset

To run the experiment you need to download the MultiATIS++ dataset.
Information about the dataset and how to download it can be found on this [github page](https://github.com/amazon-research/multiatis).

After downloading the dataset, the path to the directory containing the train, dev, test splits of each language (e.g.
`train_EN.tsv`) has to be indicated in the configuration file:
```yaml
dataset:
  # Path to TSV files for train, dev and test
  path: '/path/to/tsv/files'
```

### Offline mode (no internet connection)

If you try to run an experiment in **offline mode**, it will fail when trying to download the 
configured BERT, the associated tokenizer and the seqeval script.
To avoid this, do the following:
1. Pre-download the chosen model ('bert-base-multilingual-cased' is the one used in the paper) and the associated tokenizer (needs an internet connexion):
```python
from pathlib import Path
from utils import download_model

# Download and save locally both the model and the tokenizer from huggingface.co
download_model(save_dir=Path('/path/to/model/directory'), name='bert-base-multilingual-cased')
```
2. Get [seqeval.py](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/metrics/seqeval/seqeval.py) and save it locally. 
3. Modify `config.yml` with the paths to the dowloaded BERT model and `seqeval.py`:
```yaml
model:
  name_or_path: '/path/to/model/directory'

seqeval_path: '/path/to/seqeval.py'
```


## Run the experiments

To run an experiment, first add your `config.yml` to a new directory.

All experiments were run using seeds `0`, `100`, `200`, `300` and `400`.
You can set the seed by modifying `train.seed` in the config file.

For i.i.d. experiments the evaluation results are saved as a report to 
`<path_to_config.yml>/logs/slot_filling_report_test_<LANG>.csv`.
For continual experiments, the evaluation results are saved as a LxL performance matrix `P` (L=sequence length) to
`<path_to_config.yml>/logs/Sequence/slot_performance_test.csv`.

### Joint Transfer

To train the model on one language only (monolingual), set the `train.languages` parameter in the config file as a list
with the corresponding language code.

E.g. to train the model on English:
```yaml
train:
    languages: ['EN']
```

To train the model on a selection of languages at once (multilingual), fill the list with the associated language codes.

Then for both experiments, run the following:
```shell script
python train_iid.py --dir path/to/config.yml/directory
```

### Continual experiments

The model is trained on the sequence of languages specified in the config file under the `train.languages` parameter 
(describing the order in which the languages are learnt).

The list of sequences used to report our results can be found in `sequences_backward.lst` and 
`sequences_forward.lst`.

Summary of each continual experiment:

| experiment's name       | sequences used                     | value(s) used from `P`  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Forward Transfer (FT)   | `sequences_forward_transfer.lst`   | `P_{L,L}`               |
| Backward Transfer (BT)  | `sequences_backward_transfer.lst`  | `P_{1,L}`               |
| Language Position FT    | `sequences_forward_transfer.lst`   | `P_{i, i}`              |
| Language Position BT    | `sequences_backward_transfer.lst`  | `P_{1, i}`              |
| Zero-shot               | `sequences_backward_transfer.lst`  | `P_{i, 1}`              |

To run a continual experiment:
```shell script
python train_continual.py --dir path/to/config.yml/directory
```


### Fast Recovery

To get the associated results, we used the model checkpoints obtained from the continual experiments on 
`sequences_backward_transfer.lst` sequences.

To run a fast recovery experiment:
```shell script
python train_iid.py --dir path/to/config.yml/directory --from_ckpt --epochs <num_epochs>
```

The checkpoint saved during training in the directory containing the config file of the continual experiment will be 
automatically found if it exists.
